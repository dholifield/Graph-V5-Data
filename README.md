# Graph V5 Data
**Easy to use method of creating live graphs for the VEX V5 system.** \
This program reads data from the serial output from the V5 Brain allowing you to easily graph as many sets of data as you'd like in real-time.
## How to Use
Download the `graph.py` and `requirements.txt` files and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Then run `python graph.py` when you are ready to start graphing data. You can run this before or while the program on the V5 brain is running.

To graph the data, print out `graph_data` from your V5 program right before printing out the data you need.
```c
printf("graph_data\n");
```
Select which data to use by printing out a comma-separated list of the data labels followed by the data values, separated by `|`.\
The first value will be the x-axis that all following data points will use, which is often time.
```c
printf("time (ms),data1,data2|%d,%f,%f\n", time, data1, data2);
```
Here's an example that will graph the velocity of both flywheel motors as a function of time
```c
printf("time (ms),f1 velocity (rpm),f2 velocity (rpm)|%d,%.2f,%.2f\n", pros::millis(), fly1.get_velocity(), fly2.get_velocity);
```
You can print out as much other data as you'd like and the program will still function, as long as you follow the format and print the data after `graph_data`
## Notes
If you are having issues recognizing the V5 device, you can replace `port = find_port()` with `port = "COM1"` in main replacing `COM1` with the usb port your V5 brain is plugged into.
## Limitations
Currently, the program only supports having a single set of data for the x-axis shared by all the data sets.

The program auto-scales by doubling the x-axis range each time it reaches the edge of the screen. The default size is `chunk_size = 10000` which would be 10 seconds if using milliseconds as the x-axis, increasing to 20s, 40s, ect. If you aren't working with milliseconds and would like to change the default size, feel free to change that value in the code.

You will need to close and restart the program whenever you'd like to clear the graph.

There is currently no way to export the data which is something I'd like to add. For now, just stick to screenshots of the graphs.

I hope to develop a full GUI in the future to make the program much more user-friendly.
## What's on the Way
When I find time, I hope to make a full GUI to make the program much easier to use. This will include things such as resetting the graph, save graph or data, data visibility, different graph modes, and potentially more.
I also hope to make the serial data format more intuitive and with greater customization.
Please let me know if there are any features you would like added!
